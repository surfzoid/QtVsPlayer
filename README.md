# QtVsPlayer

QvSPlayer for Hikvision local

QvSPlayer can read local video files of Hikvision and display blue, green an red vector.

The project is young, very basique and surelly have bug.

The future should be all feature of playback from web interface but with local files rather network stream.

The library provided are for aarch64 from an Raspberry pi P400.

Using library from network or player SDK 64 bit should work but are not tested.

Write with QTcreator and QT5.
Use tge project file and setup library path.

Have a fun.
