# Depandancys  
If once installed QtVsPlayer doesn't start, go in the install dir from an console :  
cd /op/QtVsPlayer  
and then check depandancies like that  
ldd ./QtVsPlayer|grep -i found  

Qt5 runtime  
Developper package qtmultimedia5-dev   lib64qt5opengl-devel  
sudo apt-get install qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5multimediawidgets5 libqt5multimedia5-plugins libqt5multimedia5  
or
sudo urpmi qtmultimedia5 lib64qt5multimediawidgets-devel lib64qt5multimedia5 libqt5multimedia-devel 

Qt use platform tool, so qtmultimedia can use Gstreamer, ffmpeg and so on, it could be necessary to install :  
sudo urpmi gstreamer1.0-plugins-good "something RTSP too"  

To develop QtVsPlayer i'm using gnome desktop on Mageia8, i really don't know why, but QT seems broken, specialy RTSP read if i don't have the folowing RPM :  
sudo urpmi elementary-xfce-icon-theme  

Under Magia some gstreamer rpm made RTSP player crash, perhaps pluggin-bad ?  

# install
git clone https://github.com/surfzoid/QtVsPlayer.git  
cd ./QtVsPlayer  
qmake  
make  #-all -release or -debug  
 #some distro ask for root access  
sudo make install  #all-install release-install or debug-install
